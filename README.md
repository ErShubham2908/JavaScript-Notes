## Operator in JavaScript - 
In JavaScript, an operator is a special symbol used to perform operations on operands (values and variables).

### JavaScript Operators Types
1. Assignment Operators - These are used to assign values to variables. The most common assignment operator is ‘=’.
> Ex- var a = 10; let c = “PrepBytes”, const z = ‘Elevation’

2. Arithmetic Operators - These are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
> Ex - a+b, c-d, e*f, g/h, i%j.

3. Comparison Operators:  These are used to compare two values and return a Boolean value (true or false).
> Ex - a==b, c!=d, e>f, g<i, j<=k, m>=p etc.

4. Logical Operators: These are used to perform logical operations such as AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).
> Ex - a || b, c && d, e ! d

5. Bitwise Operators: These are used to perform bitwise operations on binary numbers. 
> Ex - (AND), (OR), ^ (XOR), ~ (NOT), << (left shift), and >> (right shift).

6. Conditional (ternary) operator: This operator allows for a concise way of writing an if...else statement. 
> Syntex for Condition Operator - (condition) ? (if condition true): (if condition false).
